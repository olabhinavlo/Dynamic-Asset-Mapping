# ⚡ Dynamic-Asset-Mapping (DAM)

**Ultra-Fast Class-Based Asset Loader for Modern Web Apps**

DAM is a **lightweight, high-performance JavaScript library** that dynamically loads icons and images using simple HTML class names. Inspired by Font Awesome, it replaces icon fonts and sprite sheets with a **modern, image-first, CDN-friendly architecture**.
